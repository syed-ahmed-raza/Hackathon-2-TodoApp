# Feature: AI Todo Chatbot (Phase 3)
## User Stories
- User clicks a floating "AI Assistant" button to open a chat.
- User types natural language commands (e.g., "Add a task to buy milk").
- AI processes the command using OpenAI API and adds/updates/deletes tasks in the database.
- AI confirms the action to the user.

## Constraints
- Use OpenAI Agents SDK / Chat Completion.
- No local heavy models (Save RAM).
- Backend must remain stateless.
